# FreeFontsForGameDevs
These are random fonts that i find on the web that game developers can embed into their apps. 

I in no way or shape clam ownership of these fonts.

These are all just random ones ive found across the net with the verbiage required to actually use them. Since everyone basically just doesn't want you make profit of their fonts they make it impossible to figure out what license is required and some of us dont want to pay 500.00+ for a font to go into our video games.
