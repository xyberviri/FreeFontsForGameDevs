LanaPixel
===============
A font for localizing pixel art games
---------------
Most pixel art fonts support a very small set of characters (typically basic Latin, with a few accented characters and Cyrillic if you're lucky), making them unsuitable for use in games that should  be localized. I created LanaPixel to use in my own games, but since this is a common problem, I've decided to make it available to the public.

LanaPixel contains approximately 19k characters, with support for most modern European languages (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic), Turkish (Latin), and Korean (Hangul), good support for Japanese and Simplified Chinese, and decent support for Traditional Chinese. The Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic characters are kerned where appropriate.

This is a bitmap font, containing only one size: 11px. The actual character dimensions vary, but they are all designed to look nice together. The CJK characters are 9x9 pixels, the Latin characters have a cap-height of 7px and an x-height of 5px. The font is a TTF for maximum compatibility, with the caveat that the outlines included with each glyph are *blank*, they're there only to allow the bitmaps to exist. If you find yourself getting blank characters when using this font, make sure you're using the bitmap portion of it. Just using the 11px size should be enough in most cases.

Coverage details
---------------
Latin:

- Basic Latin
- Latin-1 Supplement
- Latin Extended-A
- *Partial* Latin-Extended-B (Romanian consonants and vowels used in modern Slavic languages)
- Latin Ligatures
- Latin Full Width Forms

Greek:

- Greek
- *Partial* Greek Extended (miniscule vowels with some of the simpler diacritics)

Cyrillic:

- *Partial* Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and probably others, but verylimited support for historical characters and Cyrillic characters used for non-Slavic languages)

- CJK Half-Width punctuation
- Approximately 6970 hanzi/kanji in the CJK Unified Ideographs and Extension A blocks
	- All JIS Level 1 kanji and a large selection of Level 2 kanji. This includes all Jōyō kanji and many additional kanji.
	- Most common 3000 Simplified Chinese characters, plus a bunch of extras
	- Most common 1000 Traditional Chinese characters, plus a bunch of extras, but excluding a few that are found in Extension B
	- The appearance of the characters that are written differently in Chinese and Japanese skews towards Japanese, as I am more familiar with that language.
- Bopomofo
- Bopomofo Extended

Hangul:

- Hangul Syllables (modern Korean; trivia: this block makes up for 11k of the 19k glyphs in this font)

Miscellaneous:

- *Partial* General Punctuation (dashes and various quotes)
- *Partial* Arrows (the basic 8-directional arrows)
- *Partial* Miscellaneous Symbols (checkboxes, astrological symbols, card suits, music notes)
- Half Width Symbol Variants (half-width arrows)
- Runic (I focused on modern languages for this font, but I can't resist runes)
- Special symbols in the Private Use Area representing various controller inputs, in outline and filled styles. See the accompanying controllerbuttons.html file for a table of them.

East Asian localization caveat
---------------
The small size inevitably leads to legibility issues for more complex characters, such as some Chinese characters. To make sure your game remains legible, you should make your localizer aware of the small resolution of the text and ask them to favour wordings that use visually simpler characters. In the case of Japanese, hard-to-read kanji can usually be replaced with their kana readings.

The same goes for Korean. Closed syllables with R/L (e.g. 를 reul) are particularly hard to read at this size (and even some larger sizes!) and are best used sparingly.
